# Sustainify

Sustainify is a tool that allows users to create customized playlists which have a relevant duration for a specific activity and length of exercise! You can customize which exercise you plan to do, how long you plan to do it for, and what mood you want your playlist to be. Sustainify will automagically calculate how long your exercise will last and generate a playlist accordingly! 

All code authored by me, Surain Saigal.

To run the tool, clone this repo and run "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" or "pip install -r requirements.txt".

Then, replace the auth_token variable at the top of playlist.py with a valid auth token, which can be generated at https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-playlist-tracks/

Then, run gui.py.
